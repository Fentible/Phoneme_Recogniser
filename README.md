# Phoneme_Recogniser
 Phoneme Recogniser for Third Year Project
 
 This project is the phoneme recognition model trainer for my `Vibrotactile 
 Device` repo. The methods found in this repo were made to forward my 
 understanding of said methods and to allow for extended experimentation. 
 
 Though this work was for a university project development will continue 
 gradually with the focus primarily on other classification methods. 
 
 The dataset used is open source though it is not provided here, but can be
 easily obtained. What is provided are programs to extract the labels files
 and create train/test splits from said dataset. 
 
 All references to methods used and the dataset used can be found within 
 the report.
